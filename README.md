# Simple GLFW + GLEW Template

## Prerequisites

1. **Git**: Install Git and add `sh.exe` to your environment variable. For example:  
   `C:\Program Files\Git\bin`
   
2. **MinGW**: Ensure that MinGW is installed and properly configured for C++ development.

This template provides a basic setup for an OpenGL project using GLFW and GLEW, allowing you to quickly get started with OpenGL development.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Extract the ZIP File or Clone the Repository**  
   - If you've downloaded the ZIP file, extract its contents.  
   - Alternatively, if you've cloned the repository, open the folder in **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**.

2. **Build the Project**  
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` in VSCode to build the project using the configured build system.  
   - Ensure that the necessary build tools (like CMake) are installed and available in your system's PATH.

3. **Run and Debug**  
   - After successfully building the project, press the **Run** button or use the `Run` and `Debug` menu in VSCode to start debugging.  
   - Note: You can use `F5` to start debugging (or configure a different key if `F5` is unavailable on your keyboard).  

4. **Verify the Setup**  
   - When the application runs, a blank window should appear. This indicates that the setup is working correctly.  
   - You can now begin developing your OpenGL application!
