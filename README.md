# Simple GLFW + GLEW Template

A basic template to set up an OpenGL project using GLFW and GLEW. This template helps you get started quickly with OpenGL development.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Extract the ZIP file** or, if you've cloned the repository, open the folder with Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
   
2. **Build the Project**: 
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build the project using VSCode's build system. Ensure that you have the necessary build tools installed (e.g., CMake).

3. **Run and Debug**: 
   - After building, press the **Run** button (or use `F5` in VSCode) to start debugging and run the application.
   
   - A blank window should appear, which confirms that the setup is working. You can start developing your OpenGL application from here!

Feel free to modify the template as per your project needs!
